Noticed numerous syntax errors upon testin,maianly forgetting colons

### Unfixed Bugs
I would have liked to included more questions. I found that reducing to screen to a very small size will eventually make the answer buttons overlap. If they could be made to stack on top of eachother it would be better.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages.  
  - In the GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu,  I selected the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch was selected, the page automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
